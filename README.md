# The Ecstasy of St. Teresa

This is a project I made for mod 3 of my time at Flatiron School. I wanted to do something more artistic instead of building a simple, traditional website. 

# Materials

I only used vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML to create this app. Furthermore, I made all the pictures you see on the page.
